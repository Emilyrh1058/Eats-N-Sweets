## Description
Global Cuisine was created with the foodie in mind. During this time of global pandemic where families and indivuals are choosing to cook most of their meals instead of going out or ordering in, we are proud to bring an alernative "to the table". Simply choose a region of the world you may not have ever experienced before and indulge in popular cuisine from that area. You may not be able to travel the world right now, but who said your taste buds can't?
